# Who Should Merge a Pull Request?
One question that often comes up is whether a pull request should be merged by the person who created the pull request or by someone else. I generally recommend that pull requests be merged by the person who created them. Here’s why.
Many companies have the rule that “the person who created a pull request can’t merge it.” The reason for this is to make sure that someone doesn’t just create a pull request and merge it in without getting any feedback. The idea is good, but I don’t think the recommendation is ideal.”

# Best Practices for Pull Requests
There are a few best practices that are worth bearing in mind when working with pull requests:
* Create pull requests for everything
Anytime you want to fix a bug or add a new feature, make sure to do it on a branch and then create a pull request to get input before merging your work into master.”
* Make the titles descriptive
Other team members will be looking at the pull requests page to get a sense of what’s going on. The title should give them a good idea of what you’re working on.
* Take the time to comment
Even if you’re not @mentioned. It’ll give you a good sense of what’s going on with the project and will improve the overall quality of the work.
* @mention key people
If you want feedback from marketing, legal, and the operations team, @mention the necessary users to ensure they see the pull request and make it more likely you get feedback.
* Run the tests
Make sure that at least one developer downloads the latest changes from a pull request, checks out the appropriate branch, and runs your automated tests. It isn’t enough just to look at the code visually for nontrivial changes.
* Have a clear policy for approving pull requests
Most companies require that one or two people other than the primary author of the pull request review and provide a :+1: before the pull request is merged in.”
