# Who Should Merge a Pull Request?
One question that often comes up is whether a pull request should be merged by the person who created the pull request or by someone else. I generally recommend that pull requests be merged by the person who created them. Here’s why.
Many companies have the rule that “the person who created a pull request can’t merge it.” The reason for this is to make sure that someone doesn’t just create a pull request and merge it in without getting any feedback. The idea is good, but I don’t think the recommendation is ideal.”
